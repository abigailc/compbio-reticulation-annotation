0) I've saved the taxonomic information (in annotate_parseranger.ensure_equal_tips) associated with every tip; it would be nice to add it back in to the annotated trees after processing through rangerDTL.
1) re-run with different parameters on the rangerDTL - we are seeing a huge number of transfers in each bootstrap tree. Is this true or due to low penalty to id a transfer event?
2) fix tracking of overall bootstrap support for the species tree annotation (currently it does not track)
3) refine the "polarity of transfer" detector for use with the gene_bootstrap trees
4) run this on all datasets of all genes that I have
5) this found that the overall_subsampled_trees have tips in the gene tree that are not present in the species tree; those .fasta files need to be manually pruned and then re-aligned and re-run through RAxML.
